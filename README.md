### Progress
-> Completed database
-> Authentication, password hashing, admin accounts
-> Completed SLA entry
-> Started SLA rating

### Suggestions:
-> Limit each department to add only 5 SLAs to the database
-> Allow manager to edit department SLA after successfully adding them
-> Missing rating values, ambiguous "Service Level" field??
